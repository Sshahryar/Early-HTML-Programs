# Early-HTML-Programs

First-ever HTML (with CSS & Javascript) programs I made from 2022-2023, also the first ever computer programs I made. 

Salvaged, fixed, and revamped programs from old high school class taken in 2022-2023, personal info and classmate collaborations were removed.

Programs prompts from "A Guide To Programming in Java: Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 5". (The book begins with simple website designs and some javascript addons before introducing java)
